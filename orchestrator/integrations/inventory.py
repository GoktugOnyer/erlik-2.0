    This used to be the literal list ["WSTG-SESS-02", "WSTG-CONF-06",
    "WSTG-CLNT-07"], maintained by hand alongside a second copy in
    AssessmentConfig.test_cases. Two hand-written lists and one parser is two
    claims and one fact, and the claims were already stale: widening
    curl_request changed what the lane can run and neither list would have
    noticed. So the question is asked of the parser instead.

    A case qualifies when ALL of these hold:
      - every field its target_schema requires is one the lane supplies,
      - every one of its steps parses under curl_request, and
      - no step interpolates a field nothing supplies (see unfilled_fields).

    EVERY step, not most. A case whose steps only partly run is not a weaker
    version of that case; it is a different check with the same name, and it
    reports clean on the strength of the steps that were skipped. WSTG-INFO-02
    is the example — its first step is a plain `curl -sI`, but the two after it
    run whatweb and wafw00f, so "INFO-02 passed" here would mean almost none of
    what INFO-02 means.

    The parse requirement is why this is worth deriving: most of the catalogue
    is out of reach not because of an option we could allow, but because the
    step is a shell pipeline, names several URLs, or runs a tool that is not
    curl. Widening the curl dialect cannot reach those.

    case's own marker makes the echo the evidence.

    WSTG-INPV-18 looks for the literal `219359`, being 31337*7 evaluated. That
    reasoning held while the payload was the only case-supplied text in the
    request. Supplying a target-CHOSEN name puts a second target-controlled
    string in there, and that one comes back by design: a planted
    `<a href="/search?219359=1">` yields a CRITICAL "Server-Side Template
    Injection" from an application with no template engine at all. Measured —
    `219359` and `7777777` forge two criticals, `XPathException` and `smtplib`
    two highs, against a stub that only echoes the name.

    positive result cannot be told from its own input is not a weaker probe, it
